## Introduction
Precipitation is a critical component of the Earth's hydrological cycle, influencing water resources, agricultural productivity, and the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. Understanding precipitation patterns is essential for managing water resources, predicting flood risks, and mitigating the effects of climate change (Smith et al., 2020).

One key factor influencing global precipitation variability is the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). ENSO is a coupled ocean-atmosphere phenomenon that drives periodic changes in sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean, significantly affecting global climate systems. During El Niño events, shifts in atmospheric circulation alter rainfall patterns, leading to increased flooding in some regions and droughts in others (Trenberth et al., 2007). Conversely, La Niña events often cause contrasting precipitation anomalies, amplifying the complexity of hydrological responses worldwide (McPhaden et al., 2021).

In the context of Arlington County, Virginia, understanding the interplay between precipitation and ENSO is particularly vital for assessing flood risks. With its urbanized landscape and proximity to water bodies, Arlington is highly susceptible to flooding, especially during extreme precipitation events exacerbated by ENSO-related climate variability. Developing a nuanced understanding of these dynamics can enhance flood risk management, improve urban planning, and foster community resilience (County Climate Action Team, 2023).
